# shoot-to-kill
This is a 2D platformer game created by Lippelman515 / Matt L., a student at Missouri State University.

The main purpose of this project was to learn [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com) and make a playable game.

## Description

Shoot to Kill is a 2D platformer with a Western setting. The player plays as an outlaw disrupting the people in town by blowing up their buildings and shooting their livestock. The player collects gold that they steal from the townspeople, that could be later spent for items or temporary power ups. However, the townspeople are fighting back and the sheriff is tracking the outlaw down to keep him from leaving town.

Version 1.0 - [Try Me!](https://lippelman515.github.io/shoot-to-kill/)

## Getting Started

To build and run Shoot to Kill locally, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/download), [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com), [HaxeFlixel Addons](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/flixel-addons/) (2.8.0 +), and [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/download/) installed on your computer.
2. Open a command prompt in your copy of the source code.
3. Run the command `lime test html5` to build and run the executable in your web browser or `lime test neko` to build and run a desktop version.

## Win/Lose Condition

The player wins if they are able to defeat the sheriff and leave the area. The player will lose the game if they are stopped (killed) by a town resident or by the sheriff.

## Player Interaction
The player can move around the levels using keyboard input. The main character can use two attacks, dropping tnt and shooting a pistol. The main use of the tnt is to explode blocks that may be in the way of progression. There is a limited supply of guaranteed tnt so be sure to not waste it attacking, or you may get stuck and have to start over. Enemies do have a chance of dropping tnt but the chance is low. The attack speed of the main character is limited and the pistol is only able to fire four shots before having to reload. Reloading takes a little longer than the time between the four shots in the pistol. The player is able to reload cancel by crouching and jumping to avoid incoming bullets. There are power ups throughout the level to help you advance further and make combat easier. Once the player has defeated the sheriff,they may exit the level.
